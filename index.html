<p>
  ngWireframe is a library to help you put together quick demos or screens for requirements and usability testing.
  Sometimes a non-interactive screen isn't enough to get the idea across, and this set of CSS and Angular
  components lets you put something together that looks hand-drawn.  No one will mistake it for a nearly
  finished site, and you can focus on interaction itself.
